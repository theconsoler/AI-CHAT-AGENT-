# 🤖 Agentic AI Chat Agent using IBM Cloud Watsonx

This project demonstrates how to build an **AI-powered chat agent** using **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio** on IBM Cloud. The agent leverages foundation models and vector-based document retrieval to provide contextual, intelligent responses—showcasing core concepts of **Agentic AI** such as goal-driven dialogue, autonomy, and document-grounded Q\&A.

## 🚀 Features

* Built on **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio**
* Uses **Mistral-large foundation model**
* Supports **vector-based document retrieval**
* Interactive **document-based Q\&A agent**
* Web-based UI with agent preview and API access
* Fully deployable through **Watsonx deployment spaces**

## 📄 Setup Guide

1. Log into [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com)
2. Search for `Watsonx.ai Studio`
3. Create a new project (London region)
4. Add Cloud Object Storage (Lite plan)
5. Create & associate **Watsonx Runtime**
6. Upload your document as a **Vector Index**
7. Select **Mistral-large** as the foundation model
8. Ask contextual questions using your uploaded data
9. Save your agent and deploy via a Deployment Space
10. Access agent preview and API references

> If deployment fails, delete existing deployment spaces and assets to free up resources.

## 🧪 Demo

* Ask questions like:
  “What does the document say about AI model selection?”
  “Summarize steps for creating a deployment space.”

---

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure to select the correct **region (London)**.
* Use **Lite plans** to avoid charges during testing.
* Ensure documents are in supported formats for vector indexing.
